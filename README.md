#### **update: ELM has been updated to version 0.16, therefore this tool will not run on try-elm

A “polygon tool” which teaches about ELMs graphical support for polygons by letting students tap and click to create their desired shapes, and showing them the ELM code which does the same job programmatically

* Programmed in functional programming language ELM (similar to Haskell)
* Can be copied and pasted in http://elm-lang.org/try

## Completed Features

#####Cartesian plane
* Grid lines to help kids understand (x,y) co-ordinates
* X / Y values on both axis

#####Ability to plot precise points
* Stamps the precise (x,y) co-ordinate on-click relative to the generated graph
* Stamps the precise circle co-ordinate on-click relative to the generated graph

* Visible cursor
* Updates (x,y) position of cursor in real-time while hovering

#####Creating Shapes
* Able to pick color
* Able to pick shape style (fill vs outline)
